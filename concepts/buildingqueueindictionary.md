# Building a dictionary based queue

Queues are common and useful data structures that manage their items in a FIFO manner. This means that you push in new items at the end of the queue, and old items pop out from the beginning of the queue.

Typically, queues implement an operation to add an item to their end, which is known as an **enqueue** operation. Queues also implement an operation to remove items from their beginning, which is known as a **dequeue** operation.
